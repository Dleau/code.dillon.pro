**Abstract**: As technology advances, personal privacy is constantly being eroded for the sake of convenience. This trend is evident in the consumer grade smart home and IoT devices industry, which has enabled access to potentially compromising information about users and their homes. Current security solutions ignore convenience by requiring the purchase of additional hardware, implementing confusing, out of scope updates for a non-technical user, or quarantining a device, rendering it useless. This paper proposes a solution that simultaneously maintains convenience and privacy, tailored for the Internet of Things. We propose a novel graceful degradation technique which targets individual device functionalities for acceptance or denial at the network level. When combined with current anomaly detection and fingerprinting methods, graceful degradation provides a personalized IoT security solution for the modern user
